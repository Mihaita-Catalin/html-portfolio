<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  As an iOS developer, I worked on several applications using Swift, UIKit, and
  SwiftUI, applying the MVVM and MVC architectures and technologies like RxSwift
  and various CocoaPods libraries. I enjoy creating user friendly and secure
  apps that meet the client's needs and expectations. Additionally, I have
  expertise in frontend web development, particularly with React and TypeScript,
  enabling me to craft dynamic and responsive interfaces for web applications.

  I am also pursuing my master's degree in security of complex computer networks
  at University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest. I have a bachelor's degree in
  automatic control and computer science from the same university, and I have
  completed several online courses and certifications. I am a fast learner and I
  am open to new experiences and challenges. My greatest asset is that I can
  work hard and be dedicated to get the job done.
